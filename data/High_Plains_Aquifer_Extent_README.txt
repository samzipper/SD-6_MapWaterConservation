      Title: High Plains Aquifer
      Online_Linkage: www.KansasGIS.org
  Description:
    Abstract: These digital maps contain information on the altitude of the base, the extent, and the 1991 potentiometric surface (i.e. altitude of the water table) of the High Plains aquifer in Kansas.  Included in the High Plains aquifer are the Ogallala, Great Bend, and Equus Beds aquifers.  The High Plains aquifer consists of unconsolidated Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene silt, clay, sand, and gravel of fluvial and eolian origin and any alluvial deposits directly overlying the unconsolidated Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene deposits.  The digital maps were developed from 1:500,000-scale source information.  The altitude of the base and potentiometric surface contour interval is 50 feet with supplemental 25 foot contours for potentiometric only.
    Purpose: These digital maps were developed to be part of a multi-layer digital data base for the major aquifers in Kansas.  Potential uses of these digital maps include studies addressing the location, quantity, quality, use, management, and protection of ground-water resources in Kansas.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Datasets delivered to the Data Access and Support Center are quality assurance tested for major documentation and topological errors using macros.  The databases are evaluated based on questions similar to the following:

    Does the database's documentation properly explain the dataset?
    Does the data import properly into its native dataset environment?
    Is consistent methodology used throughout the data?
    Are all of the database's fields and values legitimate compared to the documentation?
    Is the database's topology free of errors that could impair the functionality of the data?

    Once the data is tested a report is written describing the evaluation.  A copy of the report is then forwarded to the data originator for his/her review.  If errors are found, the data originator is expected to make any necessary corrections and then provide those corrected coverages.  After these steps have been taken data is considered archivable and made available for distribution.  Data that is archived by DASC has been tested and corrected.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The digital map of the altitude of the base of the High Plains aquifer was developed from a 1:500,000-scale map by Watts and Stullken (1985).  A film positive of the original mylar negative of the map used in Watts and Stullken`s report was made and scanned to create a digital image in the AutoCAD Drawing Exchange File (DXF) format.  This DXF image was converted to an ARC/INFO digital map using the DXFARC subprogram within ARC/INFO.  The coordinates of the scanned digital map were converted from scanner inches to meters in the Lambert Conformal Conic projection (with the parameters that were approved as a standard by the Kansas State GIS Policy Board) using the TRANSFORM subprogram in ARC/INFO.  The root mean square error (RMSE) of this conversion was 0.010 (about 0.01 inch at the scale of the original map or about 130 meters on the ground).  The RMSE was relatively large because the 1:500,000 Lambert Conformal Conic base map for the scanned map varies slightly from the digital county base map of the State of Kansas (available from the State Data Access and Support Center, Lawrence, Kansas) created from 1:24,000 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle maps by the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS).  (Note:  the bedrock map was registered to the county base map).  However, the RMSE is within the suggested National Map Accuracy Standards of the USGS of 0.02 inch  at the scale of the original map (Nebert, 1989).
      Process_Date: 1995
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The digital map of the extent of the High Plains aquifer was developed from several sources.  The basic outline of the aquifer (McClain and Buddemeier, 1990) was converted to digital form by the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS).  This boundary was modified to better match the extent of the deposits that comprise the High Plains as shown in the digital version of the geologic map of Kansas [Ross, 1991; digital version available from the State GIS Data Access and Support Center (DASC)] using the ARCEDIT subprogram of ARC/INFO.  The geologic map of Kansas also was used to define areas within the boundary where deposits older than those of the High Plains aquifer crop out and the aquifer is missing.  Areas where the High Plains aquifer has little or no saturated thickness were delineated from maps by Pabst and Stullken (1984) and Hansen (1991).  The digital map is projected in the Lambert Conformal Conic projection with the parameters that were approved as a standard by the Kansas State GIS Policy Board.
      Process_Date: 1995
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The digital map of the potentiometric surface (i.e., water table) of the High Plains aquifer was developed from water levels measured in wells open to the High Plains aquifer during the 1991 nonpumping season (December 1990 through March 1991).  These water-level measurements are stored in the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS).  Water levels measured during the nonpumping season are thought to be more indicative of the general water level in the aquifer because they avoid most of the effects of localized drawdowns caused by pumping at the well or nearby wells.  The 1991 nonpumping season was chosen because 1992 was abnormally dry and many wells were not measured or their measurements were not indicative of general aquifer conditions because the wells or nearby wells were pumping or recently had been pumped.  An existing 1:500,000-scale map of the High Plains water table (Pabst and Stullken, 1984) was used as a guide in contouring the 1991 water levels.  The 1991 water-table contours were transferred onto a dimensionally stable mylar sheet and scanned to create a digital image in the AutoCAD Drawing Exchange File (DXF) format.  This DXF image was converted to an ARC/INFO digital map using the DXFARC subprogram within ARC/INFO.  The root mean square error (RMSE) of this conversion was 0.010 (about 0.01 inch at the scale of the original map or about 130 meters on the ground).  The RMSE is within the suggested National Map Accuracy Standards of the USGS of 0.02 inch at the scale of the original map (Nebert, 1989).  The digital map was registered to the statewide county base map available from the State Data Access and Support Center (Lawrence, Kansas).  Finally, the digital map was attributed and checked.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Each of the High Plains aquifer coverages contain items which assist in describing the coverage's features.  The hp_base.aat, hp_extent.aat, and hp_potent.aat contain two items named ALTITUDE_FEET and CODE.  The hp_extent.pat has a CODE item.  The following is a brief definition of each item:

      ALTITUDE_FEET-This item describes the altitude of the base of the aquifer (in feet; datum is sea level) for the hp_base coverage, the altitude (in feet) for the hp_extent coverage, and the altitude of the potentiometric surface (in feet; datum is sea level) in the High Plains aquifer as measured during the 1991 nonpumping season (i.e., December 1990 through March 1991) for the hp_potent coverage.

      CODE-This item contains a 3- or 4-digit number that indicates the type of feature represented (e.g., contour, fault, boundary), the confidence in the feature's location (i.e., approximate, inferred, speculative), and the cartographic symbol with which the feature is displayed (e.g., continuous line, dashed line) for the hp_base, hp_extent, and hp_potent coverage.  For the hp_extent coverage, the CODE item is used for a 1-digit code indicating the type of area represented by the polygon.
