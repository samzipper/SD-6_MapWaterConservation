water_right_groupings_sd6.csv = water rights groupings within and surrounding SD-6. received by email from Brownie on 5/10/2019:
    "The worksheet WR_PDS contains all the water rights, use(s) made of water, point(s)  of diversion, authorized quantity and rates from WIMAS.  Lots of stuff in here.  Some key elements:

        WR_ID is an ID used by programmers and database dorks like myself to uniquely identify an individual water right. 
            You can replace ending number in the URL below to bring up information about that water right.
            http://hercules.kgs.ku.edu/geohydro/wimas/water_right_list_direct.cfm?wr_id=1417
        PDIV_ID is an ID used by programmers and database dorks like myself to uniquely identify a point of diversion.
            You can replace ending number in the URL below to bring up information about that PD.
            http://hercules.kgs.ku.edu/geohydro/wimas/pd_list_direct.cfm?pdiv_id=15647

    The last set of columns has an ID for a unique water right group (WR_GROUP) and then how many water rights (Grp_wr_cnt) and points of diversion (Grp_pd_cnt) compose the group.  Groups are based on overlaps in place of use or point of diversion among water rights.  As a bonus, I also included a flag (SD6_flag) that indicates if the PD is in or just outside the SD6 area."
